#### Description:

## About The Project

**Image Compression With K-Means** This project is a Flask-based web application for image compression using the K-means clustering algorithm. The app reduces image size by limiting the number of unique colors, providing a compressed version for download.Supports file uploads, displays both original and compressed images, and shows the resulting color palette.
